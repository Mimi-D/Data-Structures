#ASSIGNMENT 1

1.	I created a function to generate a random list with N elements after which I wrote the dot product function which made 
use of the list generator function. When the function is called, the user is prompted to enter the size of the list. 
The value entered is used by the list generator to generate a random list with elements ranging from 1-1000. 
The dot product function then calculates the dot product.

2.	I created a point class which would collect the coordinates as a tuple. Then the rectangle class is responsible for creation of the rectangle.
It also holds the area, perimeter and intersection functions.

To run the code using a python IDE
1.	First save the file from Github to your system 
2.	Run the code normally
3.	When prompted to enter a value for the array size, enter a positive integer

NOTE: Rectangles have been created to suit the conditions given, the coordinates can be manipulated in the code.

LIMITATIONS: The function for testing intersection may only work for the conditions illustrated (given in the questions). 

To access my Github kindly use the link: https://github.com/Mimi-D/Data-Structures.git
1.	You can download or clone the code to your computer.
2.	Download by clicking the green "code" button: click on "Download Zip"
3.	To clone click on "Open with Git Desktop" if git is already installed on your machine
4.	Run with any python IDE of your choice

# ASSIGNMENT 0
For this assignment, I decided to familiarize myself with the Unix environment. I learnt a lot through watching YouTube videos. 
Firstly, I downloaded VMware which I used to install Ubuntu 20.04 and downloaded sublime text. I installed PyCharm which I used to create a virtual environment and wrote a small piece of sample code.

The code is a letter to index function. It takes in a letter in the alphabet as a string and tells you what position it is in the string containing letters of the alphabets under the identifier name "alphabets".

This was pretty simple but I decided to add an if statement (just to make it more complicated a bit). I made use of the ord() and chr() functions in python which takes integer argument and return the string representing a character at that code point and vice versa(www.journaldev.com)

To run the code in PyCharm
1.	First save the file to your system
2.	Run normally using pycharm protocol, that is before calling the function in main first run "from dsa import *"
3.	Call the function e.g letterToIndex("d")
4.	Do not forget to enclose the parameter passed in quotes
