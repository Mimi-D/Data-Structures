# Data-Structures
For this assignment, I decided to familiarize myself with the unix environment. I learnt a lot through watching youTube videos. And even though I got lost a couple of
times i figured it out. Firstly I downloaded vmware which i used to install ubunbtu 20.04
I then learnt and downloaded sublime text on my ubuntu window.
I installed pycharm which i used to create a virtual environment and wrote a small piece of sample code.
The code is a letter to index calculator. It takes in a letter in the alphabet as a string and tells you what position it is in the string containing letter of the alphabets under the identifier name "alphabets". This was pretty simple
but i decided to add a for loop as an error control(just to make it more comlicated a bit) and i made use of the ord() and chr() functions in python 
which takes integer argument and return the string representing a character at that code point and vice versa(www.journaldev.com)

to run the code in pycharm
1. first save the file to your system
2. run normally using pycharm protocol, that is before calling the function in main first run "from dsa import *"
3. Call the function e.g letterToIndex("d") 
4. Do not forget to enclose the parameter passed in quotes
