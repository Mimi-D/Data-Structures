# Data-Structures
for this assignment, I decided to familiarize myself with the unix environment. I learnt a lot through watching youTube videos. And even though I got lost a couple of
times i figured it out. Firstly I downloaded vmware which i used to install ubunbtu 20.04
I then learnt and downloaded sublime text on my ubuntu window.
I installed pycharm which i used to create a virtual environment and wrote a small piece of sample code.
The code is a letter to index calculator. It takes in a letter in the alphabet as a string and tells you what position it is in the alphabet. This was pretty simple
but i decided to add a for loop as an error control(just to make it more comlicated a bit) and i made use of the ord() and chr() functions in python 
which takes integer argument and return the string representing a character at that code point and vice versa(www.journaldev.com)

to run the code in pycharm
1. first save the file
