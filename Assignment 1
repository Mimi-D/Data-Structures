1.	I created a function to generate a random list with N elements after which I wrote the dot product function which made 
use of the list generator function. When the function is called, the user is prompted to enter the size of the list. 
The value entered is used by the list generator to generate a random list with elements ranging from 1-1000. 
The dot product function then calculates the dot product.

2.	I created a point class which would collect the coordinates as a tuple. Then the rectangle class is responsible for creation of the rectangle.
It also holds the area, perimeter and intersection functions.

To run the code using a python IDE
1.	First save the file from Github to your system 
2.	Run the code normally
3.	When prompted to enter a value for the array size, enter a positive integer

NOTE: Rectangles have been created to suit the conditions given, the coordinates can be manipulated in the code.

LIMITATIONS: The function for testing intersection may only work for the conditions illustrated (given in the questions). 

To access my Github kindly use the link: https://github.com/Mimi-D/Data-Structures.git
1.	You can download or clone the code to your computer.
2.	Download by clicking the green "code" button: click on "Download Zip"
3.	To clone click on "Open with Git Desktop" if git is already installed on your machine
4.	Run with any python IDE of your choice.
